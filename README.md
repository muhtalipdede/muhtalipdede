  <h3>I'm a Software Developer from Istanbul, Turkey &#127481;&#127479;</h3>
  
  <p>
Hello! I am Muhtalip, born in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1995. After completing my primary and high school education in Turkey, I was accepted to YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University to study Mathematics Engineering.

Since my childhood, I have had a keen interest in Mathematics and Computers, dreaming of becoming either a mathematician or a software developer. During my university years, my passion for pure mathematics and software development grew as I focused on related courses.

In my final year, I collaborated with a friend and our advisor professor to develop an IoT project. Utilizing Raspberry Pi and sensors, we collected data and stored it in a remote server database using an API. We then worked on machine learning algorithms with this data and created a mobile application for users to monitor the collected information.

Following my internship experience, I started working part-time as a software developer at DoÄŸuÅŸ Teknoloji. During this period, I had the opportunity to work with technologies like C#, VueJS, PugJS, TypeScript, and MSSQL, and gain experience in microservices architecture and domain-driven design.

After graduation, I continued my career at DoÄŸuÅŸ Teknoloji, focusing on the Financial Software team and software architecture. I also got involved in DevOps processes and gained experience with Kubernetes.

Within the organization, we initiated two entrepreneurial projects. The first was a system and mobile application for pet health records, and the second was an AI-based project focused on sustainable food waste separation.

Following these experiences, I joined Datapad as a Founding Engineer, where I had the opportunity to experience the startup journey for a year. Currently, I am a Senior Software Developer at Berkut Teknoloji.

Throughout my career, I have enjoyed software development as both a profession and a hobby. I believe building something from scratch teaches valuable lessons, and I have embraced my entrepreneurial spirit. Continuously learning through mistakes and bug fixes has been my growth mantra.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions related to mathematics or software development. I wish you joy and success in your coding adventures!
